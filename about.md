Hello there! I'm Gabriel Casanova, a Brazilian game developer. Thank you for taking the time to visit my website. I started using computers when i was around 6 years old, and once i discovered that they could obey myself and do the crazy things that i wanted i was **absolutely** hooked. 

I love retro games and i love pop culture, so expect lots of references about those in my games. In fact, so many of them that Captain America would have a [*chuckle*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzZNWqUJuA4). Double reference!

Some communities that i am associated with: [Electro Block](https://twitter.com/electro_block), [Sonic Tribute Team](https://sites.google.com/view/sonic-frost-fangame) and [LifeSim Studios](https://github.com/LifeSimStudios).

I used GameMaker: Studio to create my games for nearly 5 years and now have been moving to **LÃ–VE** and Lua to develop my newest projects.
